               So why don't you get a locksmith?

               
                             GEORGE
               I was going to, but then I found out 
               that the auto club has this free locksmith 
               service, so I signed up. Just waiting 
               for the membership to kick in.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How long has your car been sitting in 
               the Yankee parking lot?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know, about three days.

                             JERRY
               Y-you're not playin' golf?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, 
               but he gods of spring are out.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Are the courses open?

               
                             KRAMER
               No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan 
               the Caddy, we've been going through 
               the caddies entrance.
 
               
               George. Huh, No kidding?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. 
               Stan's advice has
 
               transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually 
               I'll
 
               have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my 
               dream,
 
               Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               Really, you're getting that good?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, I'm the real deal.

               
               (Knocking is heard from outside in the hallway)

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, here, Stan, in here!

               
               (Stan enters)

               
                             KRAMER
               There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, this 
               is Stan the Caddy.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               How ya doin'?

               
                             JERRY
               Hi.

               
                             STAN
               Nice to meet you. Ready to hit the links, 
               Kramer?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh yeah, you betcha.

               
                             STAN
               What are those, ah, cotton pants?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?

               
                             STAN
               Here's what you do: you bring a lightweight 
               jacket, that way the
 
               
               sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater.

               
                             KRAMER
               Ah, that makes sense, that's a good 
               call, Stan. Alright, we'll
 
               
               see you guys later, huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, we'll see ya.

               Hi!

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. 
               Who
 
               
               does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out 
               of
 
               control.

               
                             SUE ELLEN
               I was thinking that woman looks like 
               Elaine Benes.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up 
               to?
 
               
                             SUE ELLEN
               I've just been hanging out.

               
                             ELAINE
               I see.

               
                             SUE ELLEN
               Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party 
               tomorrow evening,
 
               I'd love it if you came by.

               
                             ELAINE
               Tomorrow...? I don't know if I can.
 
               
               
                             SUE ELLEN
               Nooo?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
 
               
               
                             SUE ELLEN
               Oh, that's too bad.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             SUE ELLEN
               Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha 
               ha ha.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Ha ha ha.

               Mr. Wilhelm!

               
                             WILHELM
               I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr Steinbrenner 
               and I really
 
               want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting
 
               
               in....And, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the 
               General
 
               Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boos thinks, 
               you're the
 
               man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!

               Assistant to the General Manager!! You 
               know what means?!?
 
               He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm 
               a
 
               heartbeat away!

               
                             JERRY
               That's a hell of an organization they're 
               running up there. I
 
               can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               And, it is all because of that car. 
               You see, Steinbrenner is
 
               like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, 
               he figures
 
               
               I'm the first guy in. Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. 
               He
 
               see my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between 
               the two of
 
               
               them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day!

               Hey, how ya doing?!?

               
                             ELAINE
               Better, now.

               
                             JERRY
               yeah, what happened?

               
                             ELAINE
               You know Sue Ellen Mishke?

               
                             JERRY
               Sue Ellen Mishke?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, 
               she moved here last
 
               
               year...

               
                             JERRY
               Sounds familiar.

               The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar 
               fortune--
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes. I ran into her today. This woman 
               has never, not once,
 
               ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.

               
                             GEORGE
               Ah, that is disgusting--

               
                             JERRY
               That is just shameless, I don't know, 
               There's no--
 
               
                             GEORGE
               The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               It's wrong, it's rude, and it's--

               
                             GEORGE
               It's disgusting--

               
                             ELAINE
               Alright, there's no---

               
                             GEORGE
               Come on! Come-on.

               
                             JERRY
               We're only kidding!

               
                             ELAINE
               You don't understand. See, she hasn't 
               changed at all. She
 
               stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. I was at this party, 
               and
 
               I was dating this really cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by 
               the way,
 
               and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he 
               follows
 
               her, right out the door!

               
                             JERRY
               She's your Lex Luthor!

               
                             ELAINE
               Her birthday's comin' up, so I decided 
               to get her a little
 
               present.

               
                             JERRY
               What are you going to get her?

               
                             ELAINE
               A very traditional, a very supportive, 
               brazier.
 
               
                             JERRY
               There's nothing subtle about that.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No, no, she might just think its a gift.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Have I ever bought you a jock strap 
               as a gift?

               Ahhh, Hey-Ho.

               
                             JERRY

               Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting 
               out of town with Susan
 
               for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!

               Do you think this is such a good idea, 
               with you being on the

               I happened to be in the neighborhood, 
               so I thought I'd stop
 
               in, and thank you for your lovely gift.

               restaurant out near
 
               Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.

               need ya to go out to the

               and see if there's any
 
               flyers on George's car.

               it!

               from that coffee

                             KRAMER
               No. So I got distracted and I crashed 
               the car.
 
               
                             JACKIE
               Well how would you describe this woman? 
               Would you say she was
 
               an attractive woman?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, yeah.

               
                             JACKIE
               So we got an attractive woman, wearing 
               a bra, no top, walkin'
 
               around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               She was flouting.

               
                             JACKIE
               That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, 
               vesivius, salacious,
 
               outrageous!

               
                             KRAMER
               It was outrageous. And she's the heir 
               to the O'Henry candy bar
 
               
               fortune.

               
                             JACKIE
               Could you repeat that?

               
                             KRAMER
               I said she's the heir to the O'Henry 
               candy bar fortune.
 
               
                             JACKIE
               O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling 
               candy bars. It's got
 
               chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding!
 
               
               Have you been to a doctor?

               
                             KRAMER
               No.

               
                             JACKIE
               Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an

               appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.

               
                             KRAMER
               So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we 
               got a case?
 
               
                             JACKIE
               Like taking candy from a baby.

               I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 
               'bout this? We trade Jim
 
               
               Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya 
               think?
 
               That way you have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now 
               you got
 
               a team! Ha ha ha.

               
                             SUSAN
               I don't know, George. I'm still worried 
               about this car thing.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Would ya stop worrying?

               
                             SUSAN
               Well, what about the flyers?

               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry took the flyers off the car, I 
               got the whole thing
 
               covered.

               he

               Ah, Wilhelm.

               
                             WILHELM
               Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned 
               about George Costanza.
 
               
                             STEINBRENNER
               How 'bout a 'good morning'?

               
                             WILHELM
               Yes sir, good morning, good morning, 
               sir.
 
               
                             STEINBRENNER
               Good morning to you, Wilhelm.

               
                             WILHELM
               Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, 
               the front end is based
 
               in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere.
 
               
               Obviously he was in some sort of terrible car accident, and, 
               trooper
 
               that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.

               
                             STEINBRENNER
               Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want 
               the stadium
 
               scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen. Put everyone 
               on
 
               
               alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've 
               gotta find
 
               
               that kid.

               
                             WILHELM
               Yes sir, yes sir.

               there's no sign of him. Not even anyone who remotely fits his
 
               
               description, sir.

               Kramer, it is not what you think.

               Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. 
               I think you're gaga over
 
               
               this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, 
               you're

               an innocent bystander
 
               out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing 
               quality

               I can't believe it, he was so young. 
               How could this
 
               have happened?

               
                             STEINBRENNER
               Well, he'd been logging some pretty 
               heavy hours, first
 
               one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was 
               a human

               for?!? He had
 
               30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year, he's got a rocket for 
               an arm, you

               But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying

               from you father,
 
               Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!

               Dead?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, and we had an accident with your 
               car, it's a little
 
               crumpled.

               
                             GEORGE
               My car is a little crumpled?!?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do 
               so I put it back at the
 
               stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, 
               they saw
 
               the blood, they couldn't find ya, and now that's why Steinbrenner 
               thinks
 
               
               you're dead!

               Okay, I gotta head back right away, 
               I'll -- I gotta figure
 
               something out here.

               one of these as a top.

                             GEORGE
               Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing 
               few days. After the
 
               car accident, I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on 
               grubs and
 
               
               puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.

               
                             STEINBRENNER
               Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted 
               one of those.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, 
               I think I may have found
 
               a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to 
               give up
 
               that much.

               
                             STEINBRENNER
               Well, don't tell it to me George, tell 
               it to the new
 
               Assistant to the General Manager.

               
                             GEORGE
               I didn't get the job?

               
                             STEINBRENNER
               Well, once you were dead, we couldn't 
               just sit on our
 
               hands. We had to make a move...

                             JUDGE
               You may step down.

               
                             JACKIE
               I think we got this wrapped up.

               
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
 
               
               
                             STAN
               You're close, you're on the green. You 
               just have to go for the cup.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What do you mean?

               
                             STAN
               Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.
 
               
               
                             JACKIE
               No, no, no, no!

               
                             KRAMER
               Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

               
                             JACKIE
               Stan? Who the hell is Stan?

               
                             KRAMER
               He's my caddy.

               
                             JACKIE
               You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               G- cada-

               
                             JACKIE
               Your honor, we request at this time, 
               that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
 
               
               
                             JUDGE
               This court will come to order! Go ahead 
               Miss Mishke, try it on.
 
               
               (Sue Ellen proceeds to try on the bra, over her top, but it seems 
               too
 
               small)

               
               
               
                             SUE ELLEN
               Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it 
               on.
 
               
                             JACKIE
               Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' 
               now, nothin'! I've been practicing law 
               for 25 years, you're listenin' to a 
               caddy! This is a public humiliation! 
               You can't let the defendant have control 
               of the key piece of evidence. Plus, 
               she's trying it on over a leotard, of 
               course a bra's not gonna fit on over 
               a leotard. A bra gotta fit right up 
               a person's skin, like a glove!

                             WOMAN #1
               Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, no, I don't think so.

               
                             WOMAN #2
               Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's 
               a winner.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, yeah, thanks.

               
                             WOMAN #1
               Are you sure you don't wanna go? We 
               have reservations.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble 
               gettin' a table.
 
               
                             WOMAN #1
               Ciao.

               
                             WOMAN #2
               Ba-bye.

               
               (Elaine makes a gun with her fingers and points it to her head)
 
               
               
               
               
                             THE END
